            <h2>Seeing through the screen</h2>
            <p><i>Spectacle and Blue eyes</i></p>
            <p>Shorter post today. Travelling. Currently in an airport.</p>
            <p>
                I finished <i>The Bluest Eyes</i> earlier this week. Morrison's writing tends to linger underneath,
                slowly revealing itself over time long after the actual act of reading it has concluded. I don't think 
                this is any different. I was surprised by how much the narrative does not seem to be about Pecola, despite 
                the title pointing to her importance. Rather, it uses narratives of the people who surround her, who ultimately 
                abuse (victimize?) her at every turn. It's an approach that felt especially powerful whilst working through the 
                novel's harrowing ending, when the sum of that horror is intimately exposed. 
            </p>

                I'm sitting next to a window, with a blind pulled over it. The blind is a mesh, thin yet still revealing the blurred
                colors and shapes that exist beyong it's sheild. Although the mesh is the first thing before my eyes, my focus is 
                not drawn to it. Instead, only the pseudo-reality it creates, that sits behind it, hidden from my view, is what my attention
                spends it's time on. I began reading Guy Deboard's <i>The Society of the Spectacle</i> a few days ago. I wonder if it's even possible 
                to fully divest myself of the attention I pay to the Spectacle.
