                When I was in the second grade, I had terrible handwriting. Truly, truly terrible. So bad that even a distinguished 
                grade-school English teacher of thirty years would have trouble deciphering it. So bad that every day after recess I 
                was pulled out of class and sent to a special room where for thirty minutes I would do nothing but talk to a counselor 
                and practice handwriting. Now, in hindsight, I do believe that I was truly getting testing for some level of neurodivergence, 
                a theory that continues to be proven the more I grow older, but regardless, the process did actually improve my handwriting. 
                So much so, that people generally accustomed to seeing men wield poor handwriting with a source of pride, are surprised to see 
                that I carry a decent level of clarity when I write.

                For the last four years of university, I have resisted the temptation to take notes by laptop. This is partially inspired by the 
                quality of my device, it is large and bulky and lacks a sufficient battery life to make it through the school day taking notes. But it 
                is also inspired by the feeling that comes with writing notes by hand. The fact that I can draw diagrams and doodles, and underline not just 
                once, but two or three times for emphasis. As a result of this practice, of this consistent need to draw upon my hand for writing, my penmanship 
                has not only not waned, but as arguably improved. Improved in clarity and style, with certain flourishes that have, at least to my view, a signature 
                of my craft. A small cliff drawn off the right edge of v, or the slight curve added at the bottom of a t. Had I outsourced my ability to write letters to a CPU, 
                which views letters and words as binary numbers translated into specific combinations of pixels on a screen, who knows what might have happened to my handwriting? 
                Would it even remain legible after four years?

                Sometimes, technology is the key to something new, something not yet done. Boats and planes take us places we thought impossible, telescopes shows us places beyond our reach, 
                and penicillin opened up a world of medicine unseen before. But sometimes, technology is the outsourcing of effort. Why spend the day washing clothes, then waiting another while they dry? 
                Just throw them into a machine, and wait around. But every time we outsource a task, every time we relive ourselves of the effort of some job, we lose the ability to do that job. How many 
                people know how to make rope from its bare ingredients, how many people know how to hunt for their own food or otherwise cultivate their own food?  This is not to say that technology is universally bad, and that we should all return to a hunter-gatherer lifestyle under the sun. Rather, it is observing the fact that technology has a cost. 
                And when looking at the contemporary landscape that is human civilization, it is plain and clear to see the external cost. Each year, natural disasters get worse, weather gets more extreme, the planet 
                becomes less livable. But as much as mass culture might ignore the external costs, it absolutely refuses to ignore the internal costs. As more and more children gets smart phones at at earlier and earlier ages, 
                so to does the average reading level of school children drop. As more and more adults drop the newspaper into the recycling, and flick on the twenty-four hour news cycle, so too does our conception of the truth 
                begin to falter. While technology like industrialized agriculture might do away with our ability to cultivate our own food, for many years there was always the ability for anyone of sound mind and body to <i>learn</i>. This is the 
                cost of Generative AI. While basic computers might automate away our ability to do math, cars our ability to walk, and audiovisual media our ability to read, AI automates away our ability to think. The more we 
                rely on the these second brains, these brains conveniently owned en masse by corporations, the more and more we risk losing our ability to think for ourselves. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Now again, this is not to say that the technology itself is inherently bad. The reality is that the technology exists and whether or not an individual person chooses to use it will more than likely have an effect on everyone's lives 
                in the very, very near future. I'm stressing this point heavily because I want it to be clear that I'm not arguing for or against AI itself. Once a technology is produced, it exists and will be used. Full stop. My argument lies instead 
                with the topic of <i>how</i> we use AI and to what extent. As this technology contiues to proliferate, we need to ensure that we continue to build a discipline around healthy use of the technology. To ensure that it works for us, and not the other
                way around.
