            <h1>Six Spies: Debriefing "The Vigil"</h1><hr>
            <h2><i>An essay on Ram V's 2023 comic</i></h2>
            <p><strong>I for International</strong></p>
            <p>What makes the perfect ensemble story? Is the big personalities, the big scale? Is it both? What separates the enduring legacy of teams like the <em>Fantastic Four</em> from a myriad of forgotten attempts? Humans have long had a fascination with stories of great people coming together in service of some greater purpose than themselves. From the Knights of the Round Table to the likes the X-Men, there are differences that exist on all levels, but there are also observable patterns that nonetheless emerge across all forms of this kind of story. &nbsp;</p>
            <p>Now it&rsquo;s important to note that this is not about the superhero <em>team-up. </em>Team-ups are about seven to eight people, main characters in their own right, whose genesis was often born out of a desire to push product and increase profit. The superhero <em>team</em> is first and foremost a group, treated as a singular entity, with characters whose journeys are inextricably tied to the journey of their teammates, or in most cases, those they consider family.</p>
            <p>There is an inherently individualistic nature to teams like the <em>Justice League </em>because of this. The fact is, that unless specifically avoided, stories about DC&rsquo;s greatest heroes will always trend towards being about Superman or Batman. They will always trend towards focusing on the stories and journeys of those with the biggest personalities, because characters like that of the mainstream DC pantheon are designed to be main characters. They were created to be the center of attention of their own stories, and as such, those individuals with the greatest cultural weight tend to demand the orbit of all others around themselves, as the likes of the Wonder Woman and the Flash and Green Lantern are often relegated to being a part of a static, supporting cast. There is a clear reason as to why arguably the most interesting Justice League relaunch, Justice League International, that is soon likely to have an adaptation, whose roster is enduringly iconic, was born out of the inability to use most of those big personalities.</p>
            <p>A superhero <em>team, </em>a collective of characters written <em>to be a collective</em>, operate differently than a team-up. By creating characters like the Fantastic Four as a complete sum from the start, this fight for focus is a battle not even fought. Each member has a clearly defined role within the overall dynamic. There is Batman without Superman, but there is not Reed Richards without Sue Storm.</p>
            <p>Now on the other hand, empathy is not an inborn human trait. We don&rsquo;t tend to view the world though a sense of collective reality, but instead through the narrow lens that is our individual lives. Good ensembles allow us to relate to at least one character in some capacity, and the best ones allows us to connect with every character in at least one way. Furthermore, the promise of these stories is unity. There is a promise that no matter where each of our colorful cast of heroes begins, they will end up united. The world is a complicated and often terrible place, and there is a beauty in seeing a collective love be born out of chaotic dissonance. There is a beauty in the promise that it might all work out. And for a story so deeply rooted in a place where the forces of division continue to grow so terribly, that hopeful promise matters that much more.</p>
            <p><strong>II A Fresh Familiarity</strong></p>
            <p>The grizzled veteran, the mysterious mask, the quick-footed fighter, the brute, the brain. All five members of <em>The Vigil</em> exist within familiar archetypes, lead by a morally grey doctor in the lineage of Charles Xavier or Niles Caulder. But the key difference that separates <em>The Vigil </em>from its many, many predecessors is that despite being familiar on the surface, a look into each of the incredibly human stories of the team&rsquo;s components reveals a profoundly unique perspective.</p>
            <p>Pirates, hostages, espionage. From the very first pages of issue one, <em>The Vigil</em> evokes imagery deeply tied to what we naturally think of when hearing the term &ldquo;spy thriller&rdquo;. An old, tired officer meets an energetic rookie on a bench, they exchange few words as the torch of responsibility is passed from one generation to the next. The story continues to layer the familiarity of genre onto the pages of the introduction. But upon entering the mind of Dr. Sankaran, the supposed genius that seemingly runs the Vigil, the dissonance that drives the ethos of the team is revealed. This is not a team that merely seeks to emulate the western-centric stories of cold-war spy thrillers. It is not a superhero story that seeks to merely emulate the nature of the classical American superhero.</p>
            <p>Despite the disapproving desires of the Indian government to produce a metahuman in the image of American heroes, Dr. Sankaran pressed forward. He continues leading his team with an unlikely confidence, a confidence that is born out of a difference in perspective. Dr. Sankaran understands that which his supposed superiors do not: The Vigil is not an American team, so any test which measures them against the storied history of American heroes is a test that is not to be given any measure of credibility. This is the core thesis behind the idea of the Vigil. This is a team that seemingly adopts the nature of the western superhero but is one rooted deeply in its own South Asian environment.</p>
            <p>Above all, Vigil learns from one kind of western superhero. It takes its genre queues from stories written during a tumultuous time in the western imperium, from highly influential stories created at the intersection of global espionage and the deconstruction of the superhero. From a universe crafted in part by Alan Moore, from one that beings with the letter W.</p>
            <p>And no, it&rsquo;s not Watchmen.</p>
            <p><strong>III Wildstorm goes Worldwide </strong></p>
            <p>Originally created as an independent company by Jim Lee during his time at Image Comics, Wildstorm productions only began to truly form its own identity in the late nineties. The late, fully formed Wildstorm is an incredibly important component in the history of American comics. So much so, that its influence even eclipses its own notoriety.</p>
            <p>The backbone of the early Marvel Cinematic Universe exists solely as a product of Wildstorm. <em>Avengers (2012) </em>takes its inspiration not from 60s Marvel stories, but instead from Marvel&rsquo;s original incarnation of the Ultimate Universe, which in turn exists solely as a riff on the later stages of the Wildstorm universe. On the other side of the coin, DC&rsquo;s New 52 rebrand is in that same vein. It&rsquo;s DC Comics, but make it Wildstorm. In part, what made Wildstorm so unique, so influential, is the way in which it treated the concept of the superhero with a sense of realism not seen up until that point. Realism not in the sense that it included sex, violence, and other adult themes, although it did, but more so in the way that it recognized that the inclusion of superpowered individuals in a modern, 20<sup>th</sup> century world would come with an immense load of geopolitical baggage. A world with superheroes would not mimic the world outside your window. Just as the creation of the atomic bomb shifted the levers of power in the world irrevocably, so too would the introduction of the new superpower.</p>
            <p><em>The Vigil </em>exists as a synthesis of the best parts of that defining late 90s/early 2000s comics line. Aesthetically, the influence of <em>Global Frequency </em>is immediately present. The operator of the Vigil, Nia Saha, shares a silhouette with that of Miranda Zero, the central figure to <em>Global Frequency. </em>Furthermore, the structure of the early issues of <em>The Vigil</em> bear a striking similarity to that of <em>Global Frequency</em>, with each issue focusing on different members of the team. The second and third issues of <em>The Vigil </em>deal with the consequences of heinous, abusive government experiments, similar to the same issues of <em>Global Frequency</em>. Both books deal tackle a very similar idea: that the imperial powers of the world will do whatever it takes, go to any length, and commit any number of atrocities, in order to further their own grip on the world. Likewise, the effects of a book such as <em>Planetary </em>are found in the way <em>The Vigil </em>treats the history of the DC Universe. Much like the central figure of the book Elijah Snow, Dr. Sankaran is revealed to be a near hundred-year-old figure, whose century long exploits do not exist apart of the popular, recorded history, but instead as a part of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20000711001623/http:/www.warrenellis.com/planetary_proposal.htm" target="_blank">a deep conspiratorial underbelly of the supernatural</a>.</p>
            <p><em>I&rsquo;m talking about a world in the superhero genre whose only known heroes, for the most part, are sourced in conspiracy theory and hallucinated alien histories</em></p>
            <p>The key point to be made here is that the team does not exist as a part of a colorful cast of American superheroes. They do not defend one city from a myriad of failed career criminals to crowds of praise. The work they do is dirty and necessary, but is not met with fanfare. It&rsquo;s a story that persists beyond the margins of western society, beyond the margins of what the world <em>considers </em>important. It illustrates that the ignorant comfort given to the west is built on the exploitation of those it believes itself to be above. The difference between Wildstorm and <em>The Vigil </em>is that Wildstorm was created by people within this margin. It demonstrates the evils of western superpowers from the perspective of those evils. The Vigil does not. <em>The Vigil </em>may adopt the genre sensibilities of its predecessors, but it outright rejects the underlying ethos of those stories.</p>
            <p>By what is that underlying ethos? What is the core idea found in the pages of Wildstorm? What is the final argument of a universe built on a warped sense of a post-colonial world?</p>
            <p>When it comes to Wildstorm, there&rsquo;s only one authority on the subject.</p>
            <p><strong>IV Justice by Any Means</strong></p>
            <p>Created by Warren Ellis and Bryan Hitch in 1999, <em>The Authority </em>represents the ultimate culmination of Wildstorm&rsquo;s transformation from an incredibly inconsistent image title to one of DC&rsquo;s powerhouse lines alongside the likes of Vertigo Comics. After ending the financially struggling series <em>Stormwatch </em>with the majority of <em>Wildstorm </em>characters dying, Ellis and Hitch successfully turned the rest of the remaining characters into one of the most fascinating superhero teams of all time. Lead by a hundred-year-old British bastard, Jenny Sparks, <em>The Authority </em>would exist as the only globally active superpowers, unmatched in their power and, well, their authority. For the time, this was an extraordinarily unique superhero book. From a genre perspective, these initial issues were less soap opera drama, and existed far more in the realm of high-octane action. With each arc lasting four issues, these were incredibly decompressed stories, with heavy emphasis on detailed, well-paced action over long-term character progression. Now, this is not to say that <em>The Authority </em>lacked substance, far from it. More so, <em>The Authority</em>&rsquo;s meaning existed below the surface of the action, it existed in the way that Ellis and Hitch chose to frame the team&rsquo;s destructive, existential battles. <em>The Authority, </em>above all, is a team rooted in a Western power fantasy. They are led by the ultimate symbol of European rule, a blond-haired, blue-eyed British woman with not a care in the world about the destruction she leaves behind. Her motto being &ldquo;Justice by any means&rdquo;, Jenny determines her own sense of Justice, and uses it to morally excuse her freakishly brutal nature. Furthermore, she argues that it is not just the Authority&rsquo;s job to save the world, but change it. This is an important detail about the Authority to highlight. For the stated end goal of the team was <em>not </em>to merely maintain the status quo, as so many superheroes of the time did. They did not live normal, banal private lives while waiting for the forces of evil to come to their doorstep. More so, Jenny felt as though it was her team&rsquo;s duty to use their power, their authority, to steer the world in a better direction. For Jenny, it was, in the most literal sense of the phrase, a white woman&rsquo;s burden. The only thing preventing the team from accomplishing this goal, however, the only thing stopping them from achieving their true glorious purpose, was a myriad of villainous entities. Entities that represented the various great fears of western imperialism. Enter Kaizen Gamora, and the terror of the orient. The first thing that the empires of the west went after, and the first thing they came to fear, was the Eastern world. They colonized the Asian continent to the best of their ability and waged war against nations that sought to protect themselves from that domineering control. The first threat that the west must face on its path to complete domination of the planet is the terror of the East. A core principle of western supremacy is the idea that civilization is only to be found in the west. Other nations are filled with savages, paganists, and those with inherent inferiority. They are filled with godless peoples who need to be saved by the light of Christianity. But the reality is, the colonial practices of Western powers are true terror. Rampant genocide, the spreading of disease, slavery, forced cultural conversion are all atrocities enacted by the west upon the rest of the world for hundreds of years. The fear of the east, the fear of the &ldquo;oriental horde&rdquo;, is the fear that the east will do unto the west what the west did to them. For in the minds of supremacist, there is no equality. There must be a less than and a greater than, so when those they oppress speak of liberation, they interpret &ldquo;liberation&rdquo; as &ldquo;wanting to become to oppressor&rdquo;. And ground gained by &ldquo;the other&rdquo;, is ground lost by &ldquo;the us&rdquo;. However, it is vitally important to remember that the &ldquo;east&rdquo; is not a united civilization in the same way the forces of the western colonization were. The civilizations of China, India, Japan, etc. etc. did not host a conference deciding how they were going to go about splitting up Europe in the same way European powers did for Africa with the Berlin conference. The fear of the oriental is one entirely based in projection, one based in the fear that others are just as depraved and evil as oneself. It&rsquo;s one based in a belief of a strict hierarchy, in the belief that there is always an oppressor and the oppressed. This is the root of Kaizen Gamora. A man from a fictional, southeast Asian island nation, whose entire goal is terror for terror&rsquo;s sake, evil for evil&rsquo;s sake. He is the truth of the west&rsquo;s evil without the mask of self-righteous Christian white supremacy. The evil of Kaizen Gamora being illustrated by the complete and utter destruction of Moscow, an act that is given complete scrutiny by the story, is used as the clear and singular justification of Gamora&rsquo;s evil. But the ironic, yet revealing twist, is that the means by which The Authority defeat Kaizen is the exact same way in which he enacts his own violence. By dropping a city-sized ship on the nation of Gamora, the Authority commit an equal act of mass violence as the forces of Gamora. The one difference is that from the perspective of the Authority, they are justified in this action.</p>
            <p>After the conquest of the east, after the conquest of the world, the west is faced with the only enemy that could yet face them, themselves. The next target of the forever war that drives imperialism is none other than the very powers they worked with to achieve supremacy. There is a great fear in the idea that once allies will be the same powers that inevitably take seek to destroy them. It is the fear that drove the forces of the world wars to lay waste to their own lands out of fear that the empire each nation had built would soon fall prey to their imperial neighbors. It is the fear that drove two western superpowers to use the rest of the world as the brutal playground for their &ldquo;cold&rdquo; war. This is the fear present in the depiction of Sliding Albion, the second villain of <em>The Authority</em>. Unlike the forces of Gammora, which exist as an unknown, terrible force from beyond the western sphere, Sliding Albion is a threat that Jenny Sparks is intimately familiar with. For Albion is nothing more than another name for another version of Great Britian, one that exists upon a parallel earth, but one that does not exist within the realm of the unfamiliar. For before their attack upon the Earth, Sliding Albion was once an ally to one Colonel Jennier Sparks, and the nation she served. At one point, Jenny even married one Albion&rsquo;s own. All of this is to say, is that Western Imperialism is rooted in a sense of terrible individualism, terrible selfishness. The forces of Great Britian and Sliding Albion allied not because they shared a sense of kinship, but instead because of common interest. Their allyship held not actual merit beyond the common goal of global supremacy. Once that dominion was achieved, Albion&rsquo;s goals led to a path of violence towards the place they once called their allies, and the future became written. The history of Albion even speaks to this fact. For the history of Albion is rooted in the union between imperialists. It is rooted in two species, that of imperialist Britian, and that of an unnamed expansionist alien race, coming together not out of unity of love, but a unity of purpose: the purpose being expansion. But this shared goal is inherently limited. For after European powers finished conquering the globe, their thirst for expansion turn to the only place it could, each other. And that leaves us with Sliding Albion and Great Britian, who embodied by Jenny Sparks, is forced to face down and destroy that which she once called ally, that which she once called love. And in the total and utter destruction of this opposing alien yet familiar force, Jenny Sparks, The Authority, and the Western World, is faced with only one threat to face. One singular power they must contend with before achieving true and ultimate ascension.</p>
            <p>God is many things to many people. The concept of the divine has existed for as long as humans have looked up to the stars and wondered why they wonder. But for western civilization, God exists as an excuse. God exists as the ultimate judgement upon which all their evil stems. All atrocities, all evil is done in the name of God. But what happens when the very thing you shoved your conscience onto comes to judge you? What happens when the bedrock of your society starts to disappear, displaced by the progress of industry? Or worse, what happens when God exists, but comes to judge you fairly, comes to punish you for all the sins you committed in its name? This is the question posed by the final arc of Warren Ellis and Bryan Hitch&rsquo;s <em>The Authority. </em>An inky blackness tears through America satellites and space shuttles, as the symbol of western progress is destroyed by a force that defies comprehension. A shaman speaks of an ancient truth long forgotten: Humans did not make this earth, they inherited it. This speaks to the core fear of God in the eyes of the western imperium. Like previously discussed, Western Colonizers believe that they are the only ones with proper &ldquo;civilization&rdquo;, an excuse used to justify their actions. They seek to &ldquo;fix&rdquo; the world in accordance with what they believe to be the natural course of action. But with the advent of God, with the idea of a higher power creating the natural world with a specific, and total vision, this hollow belief falls apart, as western civilization falls into nihilistic chaos. The Authority, as a representation of the west, are left with but a singular goal, to defeat God, to prove that they usurp the ultimate being. And as the Authority burrows into the literal mind of God, they destroy the very concept from the inside out. But with the destruction of God comes a cost, the cost being the life of Jennifer Sparks herself. Jenny&rsquo;s death represents the inevitable nature of imperialism, the inevitable nature of evil. For Evil is built on endless expansion, it exists solely to consume all others around it, it is a leech, one that required the life of others to sustain itself. Once they colonized the world, once they waged war against each other, and once they destroyed God, Western imperialism is left with no choice but to die, but to wither away into a shadow of what it once was.</p>
            <p>Jenny Spark&rsquo;s journey, The Authority&rsquo;s Journey, mirrors that of European powers during the age of imperialism. Her death, as a result of the death of God, mirrors the end of the British Empire, and in passing the baton to Jack Hawksmoor, an American, symbolizes the rise of the American Empire. Now you may be asking, why have I spent nearly two thousand words talking about the Authority? Because only in understanding how the western perspective informs <em>The Authority, </em>can you understand the perspective from which <em>The Vigil </em>is born.</p>
            <p><strong>V for Vigil </strong></p>
            <p>Indian Ocean, Mumbai, The N.I.A. Administration. From the first few pages of <em>The Vigil, </em>the story makes its setting known. This is not a story set in a fictional American city built on the broken promise of retrofuturism, it&rsquo;s a story in a real place, in a part of the world that has been treated as a fantasy for the west, for too long. It may be fiction, but it is fiction in the style of Wildstorm, there is a profound sense of realism just around the corner. While the stories of these spies are wrapped in a fantasy initially constructed by the west, at their core, they are Indian stories, for better and for worse.</p>
            <p>Issue two gives us our first proper introduction to a member of the Vigil, the one and only Arclight. Dressed head to toe in a slick green bodysuit, complementary with two electrified eskrima sticks and neon lights, Arclight radiates and evokes the symbols of a powerful archetype, the leader. Cyclops and Nightwing, Captain America and Batman, these are characters, this is a type, whose presence in popular culture knows no bounds, and the visual imagery is clear: <em>this is the guy in charge. </em>Furthermore, the choice to place Arclight on a mission, alone, a solo operative among a team, instantly elevates him above the rest in a way that strikes true with the likes of Nightwing versus the rest of the Titans. But upon meeting the &ldquo;fearless&rdquo; leader of our team in progress, the shell begins to break. Arclight is a <em>mess</em>; he is a complete and utter shell of a man. He is not a sexy acrobat who gets top billing on every pride special variant cover. He&rsquo;s not the prodigal son of mutant kind with more than a few girlfriends. Arclight is a man who is <em>angry, </em>he is a man who has nothing left in this world other than the mission, the job. In many ways this makes him similar to Batman, but the difference lies that at the end of the day, Bruce Wayne is a billionaire with a butler. Arclight is a man who does not even have the comfort of a home, because his home was taken from him. In between the action-packed spectacle of Arclight&rsquo;s mission, we are given a grim reminder of the reality of life. We learn that Arclight, really known as Major Aqib Khan, once had a life he felt was worth living. He had a daughter, a wife, a family that he cared for deeply. But that life, that love, was taken from him in a freak chemical accident. An accident that not only robbed Aqib of everything he held dear, but set him on the path of trying to uncover, find meaning and purpose, in the wake of such a terrible tragedy. But the truth is it wasn&rsquo;t an accident. The tragedy that killed his family was the result of corporate sabotage, it was a result of negligence and those who wished to push profit and improve the bottom line. This is not India as a fantasy full of exotic women and mythical men. This is the India of reality, <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2023/06/17/1181244389/the-worlds-worst-industrial-disaster-harmed-people-even-before-they-were-born" target="_blank">where corporate &ldquo;negligence&rdquo; has an unfortunately storied history</a>. This is the reality of a nation whose history as a capitalist colony has left a deep scar. A scar that screams fundamentally robbed a people of their agency for hundreds of years, and steered them in a disastrous direction. Arclight is not some greater-than-thou immortal who represents the sum total of his nation&rsquo;s vigor. He is but a part, a single man whose life, whose story is worth telling. He is not an idealized white man whose copy and paste origin screams unoriginality, his story is fully realized. It&rsquo;s a story that&rsquo;s deeply connectable not because it&rsquo;s marketable and appealing, it&rsquo;s a story that tugs at the heart strings because it&rsquo;s one that despite the theatrics, is very real.</p>
            <p>Issue three continues this trend of reality, as we are told the story of Nia Saha, the team&rsquo;s liaison. As previously discussed, Nia is visually modelled after Miranda Zero of <em>Global Frequency</em>, the highly capable, highly mysterious woman who acts the leader of de facto protagonist of the book. But like with Arclight, the aesthetic, the shell is just that, a shell. Nia Saha is not a mysterious superpower; she is not a hollow frame with all the answers that the story can use to push it&rsquo;s plot forward with impunity. Nia Saha is for all intents and purposes, pretty normal. She has a mother who loves her, friends who share stories, a boy chasing after her, and an &ldquo;ailing father in hospice&rdquo;. Yet again, <em>The Vigil</em> makes the deliberate choice to not only give a level of depth to the characters of its team, but also isn&rsquo;t afraid to illustrate that India is not a monolith. It is a place that is full of joy and love, and it is also a place that is full of pain and tragedy; that is not a bad thing, that is simply life.</p>
            <p>This is the core of <em>The Vigil</em>&rsquo;s story. This is the core of where the book differs from that which influences it. It does not depict stories of people who have left life behind in search of something greater than themselves. It does not depict gods among men who believe themselves to have the authority to dictate the direction of society. It is not a story about <em>superiority. </em>Warren Ellis&rsquo;s Wildstorm, fundamentally, venerates the perspective of those in power. It may claim that Jenny Sparks is a bastard, but it routinely gives her the most lines, the most voice in the narrative. The story of <em>The Vigil </em>is not a story about power. Regardless of whether or not <em>The Authority </em>wishes to portray its characters as villainous and as dastardly as those they kill, by routinely depicting these people not as people, but instead as walking nukes. An understanded moment in <em>The Authority</em> is found when Jenny Sparks asks Midnighter and Apollo what their real names are, and they simply respond, it&rsquo;s just Midnighter and Apollo. Miranda Zero, Jenny Sparks, Midnighter, Apollo, the characters that populate the world of Wildstorm do not exist beyond their power, beyond their capacity for violence. Everything they do, their every want and desire, exists as a show of force, a call to violence against those who would dare to stand against the great western empire. But not The Vigil. For the Vigil, power is a means to an end, not the end itself. These are not people who begin and end at their capacity to enact cruelty. These are a people who have lives, who have humanity, beyond a pursuit of power. The finale of the Vigil is not some great victory over an existential threat. It is not some grand violent act against those justified to be not worthy of life. The end of the Vigil is an escape, a collective unity forward into the realm between reality. The fact is the Vigil don&rsquo;t win because they destroy the bad guy, because they demonstrate that their capacity for violence is greater than all others. The Vigil win because they come together, because they show the world, they show us, that humanity, that family, is more important that domination, than imperialism. The Vigil may share in the aesthetic of Wildstorm, it may share in the genre, but it does not share its ethos, it&rsquo;s fundamental perspective. That curse (or honor depending on who you are) belongs to that of the Vigil&rsquo;s foe, it&rsquo;s ultimate antagonist, capitalism.</p>
            <p><strong>VI The Imaginary Past </strong></p>
            <p>India was not conquered by an empire. It was not the righteous belief in white man&rsquo;s burden or manifest destiny drove British settlers to being to process of colonization. It was the pursuit of wealth. India was conquered by the East India Company, a body interested in supreme exploitation. The crown may have inevitably taken control, but it was capital that enslaved the nation. This notion, this impression, that it was the monarchy&rsquo;s desire for power that created colonization is a myth. A myth created by a world currently ruled by the same capitalist forces that drove the advent of European colonization.</p>
            <p>In understanding this myth, and lie at the center of it, we can understand a fundamental truth about the nature of modern India. The truth that corporate capitalism, the natural successor of European colonization, still runs the country. <a href="https://www.tcj.com/dancing-with-death-in-laila-starr/" target="_blank">In his analysis of <em>The Many Deaths of Laila Starr, </em>another of Ram V&rsquo;s works, Ritesh Babu makes the harrowing, but necessary claim about India:</a></p>
            <p><em>&ldquo;We love capitalism, we love capitalists, and we&rsquo;re the gears that help turn its engines, it seems. We love it even as it kills us, even as so many of our own have so little and keep losing it, as others who already at the top keep gaining more and more.&rdquo;</em></p>
            <p>The truth is that the scar of colonialism is still runs deep within India, within my culture. My own parents, people whom I love very much, left India, left their home in search of capitalist success in America. They went to place built of a systematic racism, built on the very forces that oppressed our people for so long in pursuit of building wealth. They did so because Indian culture is so deeply marred by the notion that the only pathway forward is capitalism, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/20/hindu-supremacists-nationalism-tearing-india-apart-modi-bjp-rss-jnu-attacks" target="_blank">or worse</a>. It is rooted in this mindset that freedom from oppression means becoming the oppressor yourself. While I am eternally grateful for all that they have given me, there is a haunting cynicism in what they had to give up doing so. My parents had to leave the only place they&rsquo;ve ever known, leave the place where their parents lived, where their parents&rsquo; parents, and their parents&rsquo; parents&rsquo; parents lived in favor of a land built on oppression, dedicating their life to the endless pursuit of wealth. The truth about systems like capitalism is that you can never really be free of them. Unless you exist at the very top or very bottom of the hierarchy, you are always exploited by someone, and an exploiter to another. You are trapped in a system that controls you, control exercised either through the threat of starvation, homelessness, or prison; or control exercised through deep psychological fears, through the threat that if <em>you do not exploit, others will exploit you</em>. Damned if you do, damned if you don&rsquo;t. This is the capitalist way.</p>
            <p>This is why it&rsquo;s very fitting that the enemy of the <em>The Vigil</em> is not some grandiose space entity, or aliens from the beyond, but instead the enemy of <em>The Vigil </em>is a corporation. Harmonia, initially beginning as the Indian branch of Lex Corp is transformed into a militant, oppressive entity by a white man named Dr. Feistus Hep who takes control by force and threats of violence. There&rsquo;s a subtle evil there. Even in giving themselves over to capitalism, even in climbing the ladder of an American corporation in some hopeless pursuit of power, the board members of Harmonia, who are depicted to be Indian, still end up control, colonized, by a white man. There&rsquo;s a hard truth in that, a pill that needs swallowing. Liberation cannot come from a system designed to oppress.</p>
            <p>As our story unfolds, we learn more of the origins of the Vigil, we learn the terrifying secret behind the characters whose authentic humanity has been at the forefront of the tale so far. We learn that each of their lives was not a natural occurrence. We learn that Dr. Sankaran and Feistus Hep, the paternal figure and the villain, were once astral beings trapped in a place known as the Atneon. We learn that within Atneon, they both had the power to make their imagination a reality, both within Atneon, as well as on Earth. But on Earth, imagination is grounded by reality. For one could not just imagine the imaginary and expect it to stick. The more outlandish the construct was, the less the people of Earth would be able to accept it, and the more likely it would fall apart, like a sandcastle washing away in the mud. But as the tale of original sin unfolds, Feistus Hep discovers a tactic, a way to imagine the absurdity he desired without having it fall prey to the cold hard reality of Earth. He discovers MAYA.</p>
            <p>In order to create that which exists beyond known reality, one must inch the world closer and closer to the absurdity they desire. As technology progresses, that which seems impossible slowly begins to seem possible. This is not only a fact about culture at large, but a psychological fact about humanity that capitalism as been able to exploit in the form as <a href="https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/article/design-for-the-future-but-balance-it-with-your-users-present" target="_blank">MAYA, or most advanced yet acceptable</a>. People reject that which seems impossible, even if it is very possible, so in order to sell more radical technology, companies make incremental changed between product releases, slowly moving the notion of what is acceptable towards what they wish to sell. This is also similar to the method by <a href="https://www.bellingcat.com/news/americas/2018/10/11/memes-infowars-75-fascist-activists-red-pilled/" target="_blank">which Fascism indoctrinates those it wishes to conscript</a>, but that&rsquo;s a topic for another day. What&rsquo;s important here, is that <em>The Vigil&cedil;</em> the characters who we come to love, are actually born from the imagination of Dr. Sankaran after he realizes he will need help to defeat the villainous Fiestus Hep. <em>The Vigil </em>are born out of the same system that gives Hep his power. The Vigil are the product of the very thing the thing that wishes them gone, just as the lives of the people of India are in-part the product of capitalism. It&rsquo;s a deeply troubling implication, one that causes the members of the team to leave, to abdicate the lives built for them and run away.</p>
            <p>But the ending of <em>The Vigil </em>offers another path. It shows each of the members of the team come together in one final battle with the forces of Harmonia, coming together, choosing to rise above and grow beyond their harrowing origins and escape. The very last page of the series starts by showing the eye of a Bombay Duck. A fish sourced in India, yet most popular in the UK, a fitting symbol for the overarching ideas in the text. As the panels begin to move beyond the Bombay Duck, so to do the Vigil move beyond their origins. They move into the world between worlds, a place once home to <em>The Authority</em>, the Bleed, with a compelling message &ldquo;The Vigil Will Return&rdquo;.</p>
            <p>The Vigil may seem like the children of <em>The Authority</em>, they may seem like just another product of the comics IP-industrial machine, but beyond the surface, beyond the genre they inhabit, is a unique story grounded in a realism not based in large scale geo-politics, but a realism based in the lived experiences of a real place too often marginalized.</p>
            <p><em>The Vigil </em>is a tale about moving beyond what the world wants from you. It&rsquo;s a tale about a group of people who rise above what the systems of capitalism and colonization expect from them. It&rsquo;s a tale that takes the aesthetics of a universe built on a western-centric perspective and flips it into something beautiful. It&rsquo;s a tale about refusing to accept that fantasy everyone else constructs about you is real. It&rsquo;s a tale about finding humanity in a world that prioritizes power.</p>
            <p>Who are The Vigil?</p>
            <p>I think in a sense, we all are.</p>
